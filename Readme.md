# Array Analysis

## Overview

This program, written in C with embedded Intel assembly, focuses on analyzing an array to determine which number appears most frequently. It employs nested loops and efficient counting mechanisms to identify the number with the highest occurrence.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Code:**
    - Ensure you have a compatible development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Community).
    - Open the provided C file, `array_analyzer.c`, in the development environment.
    - Compile the code to generate the executable.

2. **Run the Program:**
    - Execute the generated executable to run the program.

3. **Review the Output:**
    - The program will output the number with the highest frequency in the provided array.

## File Structure

- `array_analyzer.c`: Contains the combined C and assembly code for analyzing the array.
- `README.md`: The document you're currently reading.

## Important Notes

- Ensure to follow the compilation and execution steps outlined above.
- The program uses a hardcoded array. Modify the array in the code if needed.
